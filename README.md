# Wildlife Rescue Dublin

This is a Data Centric web app for a fictional wildlife animal rescue charity.

There are various wildlife charities that rescue or rehabilitate animals whom have been involved in accidents or become ill. Sometimes members of the public find these animals and become their carers.

A part of taking care of the animals is completing paperwork as the animal's care may requires licensing. The aim of this app is to make the process easier. Members of the public can register incident cases and the charity or Governing body can follow up .

## UX

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Performance Testing

### Bugs encountered on the way

favicon

depreciated code ( count, update, ) exanple : DeprecationWarning: update is deprecated. Use replace_one, update_one or 
update_many instead. mongo.db.cases.update({"_id": ObjectId(case_id)}, { "$set": submit})



### Known issues

pagination orientation problem

### Project barriers and solutions

MongoDB verse PyMongo 

When making the case number increment based on code i read in the MongoDB manual , i couldn't get it working in my Python coee. But then i read [this article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17054494/pymongo-inc-having-issues/17054663). Hereby learning that PyMongo is slightly different from MongoDB .

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
