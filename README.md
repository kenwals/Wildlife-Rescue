# Wildlife Rescue Dublin

This is a Data Centric web app for a fictional wildlife animal rescue charity.

There are various wildlife charities that rescue or rehabilitate animals whom have been involved in accidents or become ill. Sometimes members of the public find these animals and become their carers.

A part of taking care of the animals is completing paperwork as the animal's care may requires licensing. The aim of this app is to make the process easier. Members of the public can register incident cases and the charity or Governing body can follow up.

## UX

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Performance Testing

### Bugs encountered on the way



depreciated code ( count, update, ) exanple : DeprecationWarning: update is deprecated. Use replace_one, update_one or 
update_many instead. mongo.db.cases.update({"_id": ObjectId(case_id)}, { "$set": submit})



### Known issues

Pagination orientation problem

For Pagination , I am using flask-paginate. At the time this project was being developed , this module didn't appear to support Bootstrap5 . So I have had to configure it to Bootstrap4. Still a problem placing 

Favicon

Favicons doesn't work on Android devices . 

### Project barriers and solutions

MongoDB verses PyMongo 

When making the case number increment based on code i read in the MongoDB manual , i couldn't get it working in my Python code. But then i read [this article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17054494/pymongo-inc-having-issues/17054663). Hereby learning that PyMongo is slightly different from MongoDB!.

### Version control

For version control, I used the UI on VS Code for making git commits or the GitHub desktop app, Merging was done on the GitHub site. I used branches when I was working on new features or bundles of changes.

## Deployment

For easy deployment on Heruko.com , you will need a GitHub user account and possibly a Gitpod user account. If you wish to make changes to this repository, please follow the GitHub steps first.

### GitHub

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It's free to enrol for a user account and I would recommend you have one if you wish to deploy this repository and make changes.

When you have a GitHub account you can simply click on the Fork button on the top right corner. This will clone the Wildlife-Rescue repository for your GitHub account, then you can make any changes you like.

### Gitpod

The site can be edited easily on a Gitpod online workspace, you first register a free user account on <http://gitpod.io/>, then download the Gitpod extension on your preferred internet browser. On signing up you will be expected to have a GitHub user account.

Once you have the extension on your browser, a green Gitpod button will appear beside this repository in GitHub. For best results fork the repository in your personal account before you open it in Gitpod.

### Heruko 

Heruko is a cloud platform that can hosts dynamic web applications.Once you have the completed site in your own repository, you can deploy it to Heruko by the following steps.

1. Before you setup Heruko , you first need to create some files that are necessary for it to run on the Heruko server.
2. Open a terminal window in your IDE on the root folder of the project, run the command below, this will create a new file called procfile.

    `` echo web: python run.py > Procfile ``

3. Now run the command line below. this will create a new file called requirements.txt

    `` pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt ``

4. Create a [Heruko user account](https://signup.heroku.com/login)
5. Click on the New button and choose Create a new app.
6. Input an app name and choose a region that is closest to you.
7. To input the necessary environmental variables, simply go to Settings tab, and under Config Vars, Click on Reveal Config Vars
8. Now you can deploy, the simplest way is to deploy from github, Click on the Deploy tab, Under Deployment method click on Github. A search window will prompt you to connect to the appropriate repository. You can then choose to do a manual or automatic deployment. 

### Local Deployment

If you prefer working on the repository locally on your preferred Desktop IDE, you can clone the repository to your desktop by the following steps.

1. Go to [the wildlife-rescue github page](https://github.com/kenwals/Wildlife-Rescue).
2. Above the list of files, click on the **code** button.
3. To clone the repository using **HTTPS,** under "Clone with HTTPS", click the paste icon.
   To clone the repository using an **SSH key**, click Use SSH, then click the paste icon.
   To clone a repository using **GitHub CLI,** click Use GitHub CLI, then click the paste icon.
4. Open your preferred Terminal interface.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
6. Type **git clone**, then paste the URL you copied earlier above.
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.
8. To run the app.py locally you will need to have a mongoDB account, with the supporting variables inputted in the env.py file,
 you may also need to install the packages listed Python app file.
