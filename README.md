# Wildlife Rescue Dublin

This is a Data Centric web app for a fictional wildlife animal rescue charity.

There are various wildlife charities that rescue or rehabilitate animals whom have been involved in accidents or become ill. Sometimes members of the public find these animals and become their carers.

A part of taking care of the animals is completing paperwork as the animal's care may requires licensing. The aim of this app is to make the process easier. Members of the public can register incident cases and the charity or Governing body can follow up.

## UX

### Scope

This is a fictional charity page, so there are no limitations on the content. The site will be made to an MVP first, and if there is additional time, content/features can be added.

## Testing

I tested the site as I went along, manually testing or using automated online testing tools. I focused on getting the site working on a small mobile phone screen first (iPhone 5 simulation on the Chrome Developer tools), and then subsequently all other screen sizes. Print values to terminal was used a lot when working with Python. Consoling to log when working with JavaScript.

===
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Performance Testing

### Bugs encountered on the way

#### Depreciated code warnings

While i was developing this web app. I was seeing DeprecationWarning messages coming up in the terminal log. These warnings were coming up for commands such as count and update.  So all MongoDB commands you see in my app now are using the correct and current PyMongo syntax.

Example warning message:

```
DeprecationWarning: update is deprecated. Use replace_one, update_one or 
update_many instead. mongo.db.cases.update({"_id": ObjectId(case_id)}, { "$set": submit})
```

#### Favicon handling in Python Flask

Favicons was causing errors with flask in the early stages, but i eventually got them working for all devices by experimenting with the format I think Flask expected it to be.

### Known issues

#### Pagination orientation problem

For Pagination , I am using flask-paginate. At the time this project was being developed , this module didn't appear to support Bootstrap5 . So I have had to configure it to Bootstrap4. I uses CSS to hide a "Current Page" label section that was looking off. A Bootstrap offset container is also used as i was unable to center allign the pagination otherwise.

### Project barriers and solutions

MongoDB verses PyMongo

When trying to make the case number increment based on code i read in the MongoDB manual, i couldn't get it working in my Python code. Googling the answer wasn't always leading me to the bottom of the problem, as I didn't realise PyMongo has a different syntax then MongoDB. But then i read [this article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17054494/pymongo-inc-having-issues/17054663). Hereby learning that PyMongo is slightly different from MongoDB!. So after this , i was back and forth between the two documentation sites , any useful MongoDB commands i needed to use i had to translate to PyMongo .

### Version control

For version control, I used the UI on VS Code for making git commits or the GitHub desktop app, Merging was done on the GitHub site. I used branches when I was working on new features or bundles of changes.

### Functionality Testing

Page 1 - Home page

Page 2 - Case List Page

Page 3 - New Case Page 

Page 4 - View/Edit Case Page

Page 5 - Profile Page

Page 6 - Login Page

Page 7 - Register Page

Page 8 - 404 error Page

### Responsiveness Testing

For this test, I got a list of [15 most common screen sizes](https://www.designrush.com/trends/website-dimensions) and used [http://responsivetesttool.com/](http://responsivetesttool.com/) to check responsiveness for each screen size.

The results are below. 14 Passes and 1 Fail.

### Usability Testing

I shared the project on the peer-review channel on slack, and also with friends/family. There were several problems highlighted to me which I have since fixed. Such as responsiveness to device screen width size and issues with timer.

I tested and improved accessibility with lighthouse and Firefox developer tools.
